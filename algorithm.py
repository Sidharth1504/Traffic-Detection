    Enhanced optimization that includes:
      - Dynamic greenlight timing using real-time car counts.
      - Emergency mode: at any intersection, if an ambulance is detected on any road,
        that intersection enters emergency mode. In emergency mode, the entire phase 
        corresponding to the ambulance's location is forced GREEN.
      - Fuzzy logic control (if enabled) in normal mode.
      - MLâ€“optimized (proactive) mode: an ML model predicts the optimal green time based
        on effective vehicle count and current time.
      - School release time adjustment.
      - Adds an overall congestion level for the intersection.
      - Accident detection is reported only (and does not affect the signal).
      - **New:** If one phase has no vehicles while the other has some, force the phase 
        with vehicles.
    Also ensures that one entire phase is always green.
